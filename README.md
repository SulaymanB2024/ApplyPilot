## What It Does

ApplyPilot is a 6-stage autonomous job application pipeline. It discovers jobs across 5+ boards plus Runway, scores them against your resume with AI, tailors your resume per job, writes cover letters, and **submits applications for you**. It navigates forms, uploads documents, answers screening questions, all hands-free.

Three commands. That's it.

```bash
pip install 'applypilot[discovery]'
applypilot init          # one-time setup: resume, profile, preferences, API keys
applypilot doctor        # verify your setup — shows what's installed and what's missing
applypilot run           # discover > enrich > score > tailor > cover letters
applypilot run -w 4      # same but parallel (4 threads for discovery/enrichment)
applypilot training-audit  # verify Workday, email draft, Runway, and board coverage
applypilot apply         # autonomous browser-driven submission
applypilot apply -w 3    # parallel apply (3 Chrome instances)
applypilot apply --dry-run  # fill forms without submitting
```

> **Discovery extra:** `applypilot[discovery]` installs JobSpy and its runtime scraping dependencies. If your environment hits a JobSpy resolver conflict, `applypilot doctor` will show the fallback install command.

## Two Paths

### Full Pipeline (recommended)
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Node.js (for npx), Gemini API key (free), an agent CLI (Claude Code or Codex), Chrome

Runs all 6 stages, from job discovery to autonomous application submission. This is the full power of ApplyPilot.

### Discovery + Tailoring Only
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Gemini API key (free)

Runs stages 1-5: discovers jobs, scores them, tailors your resume, generates cover letters. You submit applications manually with the AI-prepared materials.

---

## The Pipeline

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Discover** | Scrapes 5 job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs) + Runway + 48 Workday employer portals + 30 direct career sites |
| **2. Enrich** | Fetches full job descriptions via JSON-LD, CSS selectors, or AI-powered extraction |
| **3. Score** | AI rates every job 1-10 based on your resume and preferences. Only high-fit jobs proceed |
| **4. Tailor** | AI rewrites your resume per job: reorganizes, emphasizes relevant experience, adds keywords. Never fabricates |
| **5. Cover Letter** | AI generates a targeted cover letter per job |
| **6. Auto-Apply** | An agent CLI navigates application forms, fills fields, uploads documents, answers questions, and submits |

Each stage is independent. Run them all or pick what you need.

## Requirements

| Component | Required For | Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ | Everything | Core runtime |
| Node.js 18+ | Auto-apply | Needed for `npx` to run Playwright MCP server |
| Gemini API key | Scoring, tailoring, cover letters | Free tier (15 RPM / 1M tokens/day) is enough |
| Chrome/Chromium | Auto-apply | Auto-detected on most systems |
| Agent CLI | Auto-apply | Claude Code is the default executor; Codex CLI can be selected with `--agent-backend codex` |
| 1Password CLI + Chrome extension | Codex auto-apply account creation | Stores job-site logins created during autonomous applications |

**Gemini API key is free.** Get one at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com). OpenAI and local models (Ollama/llama.cpp) are also supported.

### Optional

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| CapSolver API key | Solves CAPTCHAs during auto-apply (hCaptcha, reCAPTCHA, Turnstile, FunCaptcha). Without it, CAPTCHA-blocked applications just fail gracefully |
| OS keyring | Stores API keys outside `.env` on macOS, Windows, and supported Linux desktops |

> **Note:** API keys can live in `.env` or the OS keyring. `applypilot init` asks where to store new keys.

## Configuration

All generated by `applypilot init`:

### `profile.json`
Your personal data in one structured file: contact info, work authorization, compensation, experience, skills, resume facts (preserved during tailoring), and EEO defaults. Powers scoring, tailoring, and form auto-fill.

### `searches.yaml`
Job search queries, target titles, locations, boards. Run multiple searches with different parameters.

### `.env`
API keys and runtime config: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` (optional), plus harness overrides such as `APPLYPILOT_AGENT_BACKEND`, `APPLYPILOT_EXECUTOR_MODEL`, `APPLYPILOT_SUPERVISOR_MODEL`, `APPLYPILOT_DETERMINISTIC_CONTROLLER`, `APPLYPILOT_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_CREATION`, `APPLYPILOT_ONEPASSWORD_ENABLED`, `APPLYPILOT_ONEPASSWORD_VAULT`, `APPLYPILOT_ONEPASSWORD_EXTENSION_ID`, and `APPLYPILOT_CHROME_PROFILE_DIRECTORY`. API secret values can also be stored in the OS keyring.

### Package configs (shipped with ApplyPilot)
- `config/employers.yaml` - Workday employer registry (48 preconfigured)
- `config/sites.yaml` - Direct career sites (30+), blocked sites, base URLs, manual ATS domains
- `config/searches.example.yaml` - Example search configuration

## How Stages Work

### Discover
Queries Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs via JobSpy. Scrapes Runway's explore page as a smart-extract source. Scrapes 48 Workday employer portals (configurable in `employers.yaml`). Hits 30 direct career sites with custom extractors. Deduplicates by URL.

### Enrich
Visits each job URL and extracts the full description. 3-tier cascade: JSON-LD structured data, then CSS selector patterns, then AI-powered extraction for unknown layouts.

### Score
AI scores every job 1-10 against your profile. 9-10 = strong match, 7-8 = good, 5-6 = moderate, 1-4 = skip. Only jobs above your threshold proceed to tailoring.

### Tailor
Generates a custom resume per job: reorders experience, emphasizes relevant skills, incorporates keywords from the job description. Your `resume_facts` (companies, projects, metrics) are preserved exactly. The AI reorganizes but never fabricates.

### Cover Letter
Writes a targeted cover letter per job referencing the specific company, role, and how your experience maps to their requirements.

### Auto-Apply
ApplyPilot launches Chrome and an agent executor, writes a deterministic per-job harness contract, navigates each application page, detects the form type, fills personal information and work history, uploads the tailored resume and cover letter, answers screening questions with AI, and submits. If a role only accepts email applications, the harness writes a local `email_application_draft.md` for user review instead of sending email. A live dashboard shows progress in real-time.

The Claude backend configures Playwright MCP automatically at runtime per worker. The Codex backend can be selected with `--agent-backend codex`; it defaults to `gpt-5.5` and uses a deterministic Python/Playwright controller for navigation, form detection, uploads, submit gates, screenshots, and result parsing. Codex 5.5 is only used as a fallback for ambiguous fields or screening questions that the controller cannot resolve from profile facts.

For autonomous account creation, the Codex controller requires 1Password CLI (`op`) to be installed and signed in, plus the 1Password Chrome extension installed and unlocked in the Chrome profile used by ApplyPilot. New employer/ATS logins are stored in 1Password with generated passwords and ApplyPilot metadata. API keys stay in `.env` or the OS keyring; 1Password storage is for job-site logins only. Headless mode fails closed when 1Password-backed account creation is enabled.

Each run records `deterministic_controller_plan.json`, `apply_harness_contract.json`, `apply_training_manifest.json`, screenshots, and a redacted `deterministic_controller_result.json` in the worker directory.

```bash
# Utility modes (no Chrome/agent needed)
applypilot training-audit             # audit Workday/email/Runway/board training coverage
applypilot apply --mark-applied URL    # manually mark a job as applied
applypilot apply --mark-failed URL     # manually mark a job as failed
applypilot apply --reset-failed        # reset all failed jobs for retry
applypilot apply --gen --url URL       # generate prompt file for manual debugging
```
